React Assignment 2


Q1) Render these into component:
const name = "Hello World";
const obj = {name: "Hello World Object"}
const data = ['We', 'are', 'United'] //Show these in seperate tags
const list = [{name: "Hello World 1"}, {name: "Hello World 2"}, {name: "Hello World 3"}] //Show these in seperate tags
const complex = [{company: 'XYZ', jobs: ['Javascript,' 'React']}, {company: 'ABC', jobs: ['AngularJs' 'Ionic']}]

Q2) Briefly explain with an example what's the difference between
import Something from 'package' VS import {Something} from 'package'

Q3) Just copy and paste the data from these links and store them into a variable:
const posts = https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts //copy the array from this link
const users = https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users //copy the array from this link
//DON'T USE FETCH FOR NOW

Using above API's, you've to render all the users with their names, emails and their posts.
Use `id` as a key with each data rendering.
